# Linkup Agent Skills

Linkup Agent Skills are reusable knowledge modules that help AI agents use [Linkup](https://linkup.so), a web search API that connects AI apps to the internet. Linkup is [#1 in the world for factuality](https://www.linkup.so/blog/linkup-establishes-sota-performance-on-simpleqa), scoring state-of-the-art results on OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark.

## Available Skills

**linkup-search** teaches agents how to use the Linkup API effectively — choosing between standard and deep search, writing precise queries, selecting output types, scraping webpages, filtering domains, and using proven prompt patterns for business intelligence and research.

## How Skills Work

Skills are **knowledge for AI agents**, not tools. They provide procedural knowledge that agents load when a user request matches the skill's purpose. The agent then follows the skill's guidance to make better API calls — whether through MCP integration, SDK code generation, or direct user instruction.

## Getting Started

```bash
npx skills add LinkupPlatform/skills
